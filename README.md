# Calculator JS

## 📌 About the Project

Calculator JS is a simple calculator built with vanilla JavaScript. It performs common mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and factorial.

This project was developed with a focus on code organization, modularity, and clean separation of responsibilities, simulating a more professional workflow.

## ✨ Features

* Basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), division (÷)
* Exponentiation (**)
* Factorial (!)
* Clear buttons (C / AC)
* Delete last digit
* Responsive interface
* Decimal number support

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🧱 Project Structure

The project is organized using a clear separation of concerns:

* **HTML**: Responsible for the application structure
* **CSS**: Handles styling and layout
* **JavaScript**: Fully modularized logic

All calculator logic is located in the `logic` folder, where each responsibility is separated into its own module, such as:

* Application flow control
* Calculation logic
* Event handling
* State management
* UI updates

This structure improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.

## 📚 What I Learned

This was my first project developed in a more professional way. Through it, I learned how to:

* Divide a project into independent and reusable modules
* Decouple logic from the user interface
* Treat each part of the application as an isolated responsibility
* Implement basic state control
* Apply initial testing concepts

## ⚠️ Challenges

* Organizing files and folders correctly for the first time
* Designing the calculator flow logic
* Defining the correct order of operations and user interactions
* Structuring the project without putting everything into a single file

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

* Full keyboard support
* Operation history
* Theme switching (light / dark mode)
* Support for more complex calculations (parentheses, multiple factors, fractions)
* Square root support
* Predefined formulas (e.g., Bhaskara)
* Unit and value conversions
